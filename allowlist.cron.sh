#! /bin/bash

# Allowlist-cron.sh
# A script which can run as a cron job and notifies if the list
# of Fastly IPs has changed compared to the previous known list.
#
# This requires your system to have:
#    curl - a command line web client
#    md5(sum) - a command for calculating and checking sums of files
#    mail(x) - a command line mail/smtp client
#
#
# Stores the list of 'current' IPs in CURRENT_IPS_FILE and uses diff
#Â to see if this has changed.
#
# If you have any bugs or issues with this script you can find assitance
# in the Fastly community forum at https://community.fastly.com/
#
# If you would like to submit a pull request or patch, please do so at my
# github repository: https://github.com/jondade/Fastly-IP-allowlist-notify
